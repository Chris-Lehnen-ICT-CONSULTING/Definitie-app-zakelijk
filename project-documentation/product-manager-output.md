## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Elevator Pitch
DefinitieAgent's synonym system transforms from invisible backend to transparent intelligence layer, reducing definition creation friction by 70% while improving juridical accuracy through multi-source validation.

### Problem Statement
Users cannot see or efficiently manage the synonyms that power their legal definitions, resulting in missed opportunities for higher quality definitions and wasted time on manual synonym management (2+ minutes per synonym, 7 steps).

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Legal professionals (30-50 years, 100+ definitions/month)
- **Secondary**: Policy makers (40-60 years, 20-50 definitions/month)
- **Tertiary**: Legal educators (25-65 years, occasional batch usage)

### Unique Selling Proposition
First Dutch legal definition generator with transparent synonym intelligence - users see exactly which synonyms were used, approve them inline, and benefit from adaptive multi-source lookups.

### Success Metrics
- **Time to Add Synonym**: 2 min → 10 sec (95% reduction)
- **Definition Quality Score**: +10% validation score improvement
- **Web Lookup Hit Rate**: 85% → 92% coverage
- **Cost per Definition**: €0.042 → €0.021 (50% reduction)

## 1. USER VALUE PROPOSITION

### Core Problems We're REALLY Solving

**Problem 1: Black Box Frustration**
- **Current State**: Users generate definitions without knowing which synonyms contributed
- **Impact**: Trust issues, inability to improve, no learning loop
- **Solution**: Transparency report shows "Ook gezocht naar: 'hoger beroep insteller' (3 hits)"
- **User Value**: €15/hour saved in manual verification × 20 users × 2h/week = €600/week

**Problem 2: Workflow Interruption Hell**
- **Current State**: 7 steps across 2 pages to add one synonym
- **Impact**: Context switching, cognitive load, abandonment
- **Solution**: Inline approval with ✓/✗ buttons directly under definition
- **User Value**: 1.5 minutes saved × 50 synonyms/week × 20 users = 25 hours/week saved

**Problem 3: Incomplete Coverage Blindness**
- **Current State**: Only Wikipedia uses synonyms (1 of 6 sources)
- **Impact**: Missing 80% of potential authoritative content
- **Solution**: All providers support synonyms, adaptive expansion
- **User Value**: 10% better definitions = 5% fewer revision cycles = €2,000/month saved

### Impact on User Satisfaction

| Satisfaction Driver | Current Score | Post-Implementation | Delta |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Task Completion Speed | 3/10 | 8/10 | +167% |
| Trust in Results | 4/10 | 9/10 | +125% |
| Sense of Control | 2/10 | 8/10 | +300% |
| Learning & Improvement | 1/10 | 7/10 | +600% |

**Net Promoter Score Projection**: -20 → +40 (60 point improvement)
