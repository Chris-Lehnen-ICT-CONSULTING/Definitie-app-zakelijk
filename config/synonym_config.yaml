  # ========================================
  # GOVERNANCE POLICY
  # ========================================

  # Policy for synonym usage in weblookup and definition generation
  #
  # Options:
  #   - strict: Only approved synonyms (status='active') are used
  #   - pragmatic: AI-pending synonyms are also allowed for weblookup
  #
  # Recommendation: Use 'strict' for compliance-critical environments,
  #                 'pragmatic' for development/testing
  policy: strict

  # ========================================
  # ENRICHMENT SETTINGS
  # ========================================

  # Minimum synonyms threshold before GPT-4 enrichment is triggered
  # If a term has fewer than this many synonyms, GPT-4 will be called
  # to suggest additional synonyms during definition generation
  #
  # Range: >= 1
  # Default: 5
  min_synonyms: 5

  # Timeout for GPT-4 API calls (in seconds)
  # How long to wait for GPT-4 synonym suggestions before giving up
  #
  # Range: 5-300 seconds (5s min, 5 min max)
  # Default: 30
  gpt4_timeout: 30

  # Maximum retry attempts for GPT-4 API failures
  # How many times to retry if GPT-4 call fails
  #
  # Range: 0-10
  # Default: 3
  gpt4_max_retries: 3

  # ========================================
  # CACHING SETTINGS
  # ========================================

  # Time-to-live for cache entries (in seconds)
  # How long to keep synonym lookups in cache before re-querying database
  #
  # Range: 60-86400 seconds (1 min - 24 hours)
  # Default: 3600 (1 hour)
  cache_ttl: 3600

  # Maximum number of cache entries
  # Prevents unbounded memory growth
  #
  # Range: 10-100000
  # Default: 1000
  cache_max_size: 1000

  # ========================================
  # WEIGHT THRESHOLDS
  # ========================================

  # Minimum weight for synonyms to be included in weblookup
  # Synonyms with weight below this threshold are excluded
  #
  # Range: 0.0-1.0
  # Default: 0.7
  min_weight: 0.7

  # Weight threshold for marking synonyms as "preferred"
  # Synonyms with weight >= this value get is_preferred flag
  #
  # Range: 0.0-1.0 (must be >= min_weight)
  # Default: 0.95
  preferred_threshold: 0.95
